## Inspiration 
The pandemic have disrupted millions of jobs around the world. Some got retrenched while others just can't seem to find a job in this bear job market. It is thereby increasingly important for employees and employers alike to adopt effective technological solutions for effective job seeking and recruitment. However, excessive use of artificial intelligence have done more harm than good for job seeking and recruitment process. These are some of the problems identified: 
- Hiring softwares make it easy for employees to list their resumes, but it also **makes it easy for employer to never see them**

- Sometimes, **what these softwares are looking for in a resume does not make sense** as well. For instance, hiring softwares will look for nurses with computer programming skills even though they just need data entry in their jobs. 

- More often than not, hiring managers will **decide to reject or ignore a particular applicant based on the resume alone** as well. Such practices results in hiring manager **ignoring the soft skills** of applicants and even their potential to do well in the respective roles though they have limited skill sets in the present. 

Therefore, our team hopes to bring back the human touch to job seeking and recruitment, make recruitment for easy and efficient for both employees and employers and improve the state of the job market as we transition to the post-pandemic world. 

## What it does
Our application hopes to provide a quick but meaningful job recruitment process for both the employees and employers. 

### Quick Process
> The application boasts a popular swiping mechanism from the popular dating app, Tinder, to help with the job searching and recruitment process. Employees and employers will post a summarised and shortened profile in our application. Such profiles even give both employees and employers a chance to have a short self-introduction or post professional photos of themselves, giving a chance for them to be evaluated not just based of words and experience. Furthermore, based on our algorithm both employees and employers will decide whether to swipe right, if they are interested in the particular employee or company respectively, or swipe left, if they are not interested. **Such a process gives both employees and employers an opportunity to be evaluated not just from words but based on how one portrays themselves, where soft skills can shine.**

### Meaningful Recruitment
> After an employee and employer has a match, they can proceed to the next stage of the recruitment process where they can schedule an interview to go through technicalities and get to know each other more, just like a regular job recruitment. The differentiator here is that **employers will be required to give their feedback or reasons why he or she is rejected or recruited in the company to complete the recruitment process in our application.** Employers will be rated based on the quality of feedback given, the higher the rating, the more their company will show up based on our algorithm. Employees will also benefit from knowing what he or she is lacking in terms of skill sets, and our app will also directly recommend relevant courses for up-skilling. Even if a particularly employer rejects an applicant, a record of the entire recruitment process will be stored within the app and is available for review if the applicant comes back with renewed skills after attending courses recommended by our application. This will facilitate the recruitment process in the future as well. 

With a quick and meaningful recruitment process focusing on up-skilling or employees and finding quality and hungry applicants for employers, we hope that our app can revolutionise how job seeking and recruitment is done, for the better.

## How we built it
Our team built our application using Android Studio and Firebase. 

### Android Studios
Android Studios as our main IDE to code out our project. This is where we coded out both the user-interface and the logic for each page of our application. We utilised MVC framework and created our own custom models to be controlled by the data adapters in Android Studios.

### Firebase
Information that the user inputs in our application is then passed on into the Firebase for storage. Firebase is also the software that our team uses to organise how our data is stored for the application.

## Challenges we ran into
The main challenge that our team faced was the limitation of time. Given that our solution is quite a big idea, it was a challenge for us to finish all the deliverables within a week, especially given that it is the first hackathon experience for most of us. 

We have also identified several elements of the user interface that can be improved but unfortunately we have insufficient time and the lack of expertise to do so.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our team is very happy of being able to make the app work to showcase the concept of our solution despite the time limitation and the numerous challenges that we had. We hope that all of us can continue to develop and improve our skills and join more hackathons together and compete.

## What we learned
- Android Studios 
- Java Programming
- Firebase
- Hackathon Project Management
- Efficient Work Delegation

## What's next for Preztel
Our team hopes to use this experience as a jumpstart for our future endeavours. Hopefully we can continue to join and compete in numerous hackathons to improve ourselves and become quality developers in our own right.
